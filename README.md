# Difference Between `htons`, `htonl`, and Related Functions

This table explains the purpose and usage of the functions `htons`, `htonl`, `ntohs`, and `ntohl`, which are crucial for handling byte order conversion in network programming.

| **Function** | **Purpose**                                | **Converts Data Type**            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `htons`      | Host to Network Short                     | 16-bit short (e.g., port)         |
| `htonl`      | Host to Network Long                      | 32-bit long (e.g., IP address)    |
| `ntohs`      | Network to Host Short (reverse of `htons`) | 16-bit short                      |
| `ntohl`      | Network to Host Long (reverse of `htonl`)  | 32-bit long                       |

## Explanation

### 1. `htons` (Host to Network Short)
- Converts a 16-bit integer from the host's byte order to the network byte order.
- Commonly used for port numbers.

### 2. `htonl` (Host to Network Long)
- Converts a 32-bit integer from the host's byte order to the network byte order.
- Used for IP addresses and other long integers.

### 3. `ntohs` (Network to Host Short)
- Reverses the operation of `htons`, converting a 16-bit integer from network byte order to the host's byte order.

### 4. `ntohl` (Network to Host Long)
- Reverses the operation of `htonl`, converting a 32-bit integer from network byte order to the host's byte order.

### Importance in Networking
Network protocols use **big-endian** byte order, but many host machines (e.g., x86 architecture) use **little-endian** byte order. These functions ensure consistent data interpretation between different systems.


`The reason your server fails to bind the socket when you run the code again is likely that the previous instance of the server has not released the resources (specifically, the socket). This happens because the operating system keeps the socket in the TIME_WAIT state after it is closed to ensure proper handling of any delayed packets.`
